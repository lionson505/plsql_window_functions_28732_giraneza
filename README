Q1. business context
      .company type is online learning platform

      . department is student Experience and Academic Success

      Industry is E-Learnig


    Data Challenge we've noticied that many students start their learning journey with hight energy but lost momentume after the first week


    Expected Outcome The goal is to create a student Success Map that identifies exactly where learner get stuck or discouraged. By Understanding these patterns, we can providepersonalized study remainder and extra learning support at the exact moment a student feels like giving up, helping more students reach their goal of earning a certificate



Q2  Example of e-learning scenario

   RANK() it helps learners trust they are picking the best courses

   SUM() OVER() show learners their streak and sense of accomplishment

   LAG() LEAD() prevents discouragement by showing growth compare to privous weeks
   AVG() OVER()  show bigger picture of learner growth overtime.
   NTILE it's group learners to identify high, medium, and low engagement levels 


Q3 Tables (at least 3)

**Learners (students/users)**
- learner_id (PK)
- first_name
- last_name
- email
- region

**Courses**
- course_id (PK)
- course_name
- category
- level

**Enrollments / Progress (join table tracking learner activity)**
- enrollment_id (PK)
- learner_id (FK → Learners)
- course_id (FK → Courses)
- completion_percentage
- week_number
- score 




Q4 Part A — SQL JOINs Implementation

   -- List all students with their courses
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.course_name, sc.enrollment_status
FROM student_courses sc
INNER JOIN students s ON sc.student_id = s.id
INNER JOIN courses c ON sc.course_id = c.id;

-- Students who never enrolled in any course
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, sc.course_id
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN student_courses sc ON s.id = sc.student_id
WHERE sc.course_id IS NULL;
/home/lionson/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2026-02-06 11-47-07.png



-- Courses without any students
SELECT c.course_name, s.first_name, s.last_name
FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN student_courses sc ON c.id = sc.course_id
LEFT JOIN students s ON sc.student_id = s.id
WHERE sc.student_id IS NULL;
/home/lionson/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2026-02-06 11-47-27.png


-- All students and all courses, even if no enrollment
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.course_name
FROM students s
FULL OUTER JOIN student_courses sc ON s.id = sc.student_id
FULL OUTER JOIN courses c ON sc.course_id = c.id;
/home/lionson/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2026-02-06 11-47-47.png



-- Students in the same course
SELECT s1.first_name AS student1, s2.first_name AS student2, c.course_name
FROM student_courses sc1
JOIN student_courses sc2 ON sc1.course_id = sc2.course_id AND sc1.student_id <> sc2.student_id
JOIN students s1 ON sc1.student_id = s1.id
JOIN students s2 ON sc2.student_id = s2.id
JOIN courses c ON sc1.course_id = c.id;

Q4 Part B — SQL Aggregations Implementation



    


    -- Rank students by number of courses enrolled
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, COUNT(sc.course_id) AS total_courses,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(sc.course_id) DESC) AS course_rank
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN student_courses sc ON s.id = sc.student_id
GROUP BY s.id
ORDER BY course_rank;
/home/lionson/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2026-02-06 11-53-24.png





-- Running total of students enrolled per course
SELECT c.course_name, s.first_name, s.last_name,
       COUNT(sc.student_id) OVER (PARTITION BY c.id ORDER BY s.id ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN student_courses sc ON c.id = sc.course_id
LEFT JOIN students s ON sc.student_id = s.id
ORDER BY c.course_name, s.id;
/home/lionson/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2026-02-06 11-54-21.png





-- Divide students into quartiles based on total courses enrolled
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, COUNT(sc.course_id) AS total_courses,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(sc.course_id) DESC) AS quartile
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN student_courses sc ON s.id = sc.student_id
GROUP BY s.id
ORDER BY quartile;
